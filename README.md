# About THE HAIGHWAY

Welcome !!! Here is a quick presentation of **THE HAIGHWAY**.

**THE HAIGHWAY** is a training company in AI, Data and Cloud. Our mission is to help you upskill as you were on the job. We offer free and paid learning ressources in **English** & **French**.

Our free ressources include: 
- GitHub repositories, articles and newsletters
- Short videos and short courses

Our paid ressources include:
- Self-paced and cohort-based bootcamps and courses
- On-demand courses for comapnies

We value well organized ressources. We assume that Juniors don't know what to learn next and want guidance. We assume that Seniors sometimes know what to learn next and want to find what the are looking for with minimum effort. 

We classify our ressources in three levels:
- Main : general skills
- Focus : focus on specific set of skills or technologies
- Projects : end-to-end cases

We classify skills for a given role in three concentric categories:
- Basics : basic skills but unsufficient to be competitive on the job market
- Junior : core skills relevant for most companies
- Senior : advanced knowledge and skills relevant for most companies

We distinguish three levels of mastering of tools and technologies:
- Beginner : intial knowledge
- Intermediate : intermediate knowledge
- Advanced : Advanced knowledge

🔔 **That's all for now. Some ressources are not yet publicly available. More information is comming soon, so make sure to stay tuned. Enjoy !!!**
