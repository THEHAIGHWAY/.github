**THE HAIGHWAY** is a learning path designed to help junior ML/AI engineers develop advanced skills in ML & AI engineering. Its goal is to equip learners with senior-level or staff-level technical expertise in AI/ML system design and engineering by building production-grade AI/ML systems.

The path combines both free and paid resources.
- **Free resources** include [GitHub repositories](https://github.com/THEHAIGHWAY), a [Substack newsletter](https://thehaighway.substack.com/) and a [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@THEHAIGHWAY).
- **Paid resources** are offered through a learning platform by **ECHAILON**.

The learning path is organized into two streams:
- [**The Mainline**](#the-mainline): our structured core in AI/ML system design and engineering.
- [**The Byways**](#the-byways): specialized routes that extend and enrich the journey.
